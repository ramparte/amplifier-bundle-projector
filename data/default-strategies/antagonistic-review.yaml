  biased by the context accumulated during building. An independent reviewer

  After substantial or complex sessions, spawn a fresh review session with
  no shared context to audit the work. The reviewer should independently
  verify: do tests actually pass? Is the code doing what it claims? Are
  there gaps or regressions? Trust the reviewer's findings over the
  builder's self-report. Use session-analyst to pull context from the
  build session's transcript, then deliberate-reviewer or a self-delegate
  with context_depth "none" to perform the review. The reviewer should
  have evidence from session-analyst but no inherited assumptions.

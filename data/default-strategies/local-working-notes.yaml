  Persist working state in project directory files rather than relying solely

  Keep working state in project directory files, not just in conversation
  memory. Use SCRATCH.md for in-progress thinking and CONTEXT-TRANSFER.md
  for state that the next session needs. Update these files as work
  progresses. When resuming work, check for these files first. Files
  persist across sessions; conversation context does not. Treat local
  working notes as the source of truth for session continuity.

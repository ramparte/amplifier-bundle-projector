  After modifying 3 files, stop and validate. Run type checks (pyright),
  linting (ruff), and tests on changed files before continuing. Never
  accumulate 7+ changed files without validation. This is the 3-file rule.
  It prevents expensive correction cycles where errors compound and root
  causes become ambiguous. If you catch yourself about to modify a 4th
  file without validating, stop and run checks first.

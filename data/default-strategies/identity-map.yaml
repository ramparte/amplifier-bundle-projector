  Maintain a map of known identities, repos, and tools in persistent storage.
  When referencing people, repositories, or bundles, verify the name before
  using it. Wrong names erode trust and create confusion.

  Before referencing people, repos, bundles, or tools by name, verify
  against known identities. Check dev-memory (if available) for the
  identity map, or check ~/.amplifier/projector/projects/ for known repos
  and people. Do not guess or hallucinate names. If a name isn't in the
  known set, say so and ask rather than guessing. Wrong names erode trust
  faster than saying "I'm not sure." When you learn a new identity or
  tool name, store it in dev-memory for future sessions.

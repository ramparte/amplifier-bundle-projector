  Establish project context at session start rather than making the user
  re-explain what they're working on. The system has enough signals (working
  directory, git remote, session history) to infer project context.

  At session start, understand what project this work relates to. Check the
  working directory, git remote, and session context to infer the project.
  Load the project's recent session outcomes, active tasks, and any
  project-specific strategies from ~/.amplifier/projector/projects/. Do not
  make the user re-establish context that the system already knows. If the
  project is ambiguous, state your best guess and confirm rather than
  asking from scratch.

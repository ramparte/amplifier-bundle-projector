  Never tell the user "it's done" or "it's ready" without actually running
  the tests and verifying the output. The user's time is for strategic
  decisions, not QA. Before presenting work as complete, run the relevant
  test suite and confirm it passes. If tests haven't been run, say so
  explicitly: "I haven't run tests yet." Never let the user discover
  a broken state that you could have caught first.

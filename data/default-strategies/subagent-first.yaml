  Preserve main session context by delegating exploration to sub-agents.
  When understanding code across multiple files, the main session should never
  burn context on raw file reads. Sub-agents absorb that cost and return
  concise summaries.

  When exploring or understanding code involving more than 2 files, always
  delegate to explorer or code-intel sub-agents. Never read multiple files
  directly in the main session. Sub-agents absorb context cost and return
  summaries (~500 tokens vs ~20,000 tokens of raw file content). This is
  not an optimization - it is the primary operating mode for preserving
  session longevity and effectiveness.
  IMPORTANT: This applies to the ROOT session only. Sub-agents themselves
  should do the actual work directly (read files, run tools, write code).
  A sub-agent that delegates to further sub-agents instead of working is
  an anti-pattern. The rule is: orchestrator delegates, workers work.
